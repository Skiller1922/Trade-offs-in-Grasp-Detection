Trade-offs in Grasp Detection: Analyzing the Balance Between Accuracy and Computational Time Using Reduced Layer Convolutional Neural Networks

## Description

This project examines the trade-off between grasp detection accuracy and computational speed in robotic systems. By analyzing the performance of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we determine if reduced-layer CNNs can sustain necessary accuracy and precision for effective robotic handling without compromising real-time functionality. We conducted comparative experiments across various CNN architectures with different numbers of convolutional layers to quantify their grasp detection capabilities in terms of accuracy, precision, and processing time.

## Key Findings

- Select CNNs can deliver efficient grasp detection with minimal performance loss.
- The feasibility of employing reduced-layer CNNs in robotic systems has been demonstrated, paving the way for enhanced object manipulation in real-time operational settings.
